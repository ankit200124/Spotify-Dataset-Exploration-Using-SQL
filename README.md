# Spotify-Dataset-Exploration-Using-SQL
![spotify logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b67c358-d796-4583-a36d-d181ddac6f83)


# Overview
This project focuses on exploring a raw Spotify dataset that includes detailed information about tracks, albums, and artists. The process begins by converting the unorganized data into a well-structured format through normalization. Various SQL queries are then applied, ranging from basic to complex, to uncover useful insights. The main objective is to strengthen SQL knowledge while analyzing real music data and improving query performance.

# Objective
To develop and apply advanced SQL skills by analyzing Spotifyâ€™s music dataset. The goal is to transform unstructured data into a usable format and generate practical insights through well-structured and performance-optimized SQL queries.

#  Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes such as track names, album details, artist names, stream counts, likes, comments, views, and musical features like energy, danceability, and liveness. It was initially unstructured and required normalization for accurate querying and analysis.

# Business Problems and Solutions

# Retrieve all tracks with over 1 billion streams
```
SELECT * 
FROM spotify 
WHERE stream > 1000000000;
```
# List all albums with their respective artists
```
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist 
FROM spotify 
ORDER BY album;
```
# Get the total number of comments where the track is licensed
```
SELECT SUM(comments) AS total_comments

WHERE licensed = 'true';
```
# Find all tracks that are released as singles
```
SELECT track 
FROM spotify

```
# Count the total number of tracks for each artist
```
SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS total_tracks

```
# Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album
```
SELECT album, AVG(danceability) AS average_dance

GROUP BY album 
ORDER BY average_dance DESC;
```
# Get the top 5 tracks with the highest energy
```
SELECT track, MAX(energy) 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY track 
ORDER BY MAX(energy) DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
# Show total views and likes for tracks marked as official videos
```
SELECT track, 
       SUM(views) AS total_views, 
       SUM(likes) AS total_likes 
FROM spotify 
WHERE official_video = 'true' 
GROUP BY track 
ORDER BY total_views DESC;
```
# Calculate total views per album
```
SELECT album, track, SUM(views) AS total_views 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY album, track 
ORDER BY total_views DESC;
```
# Retrieve track names with more streams on Spotify than YouTube
```
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT track,
         COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Youtube' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_youtube,
         COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END), 0) AS streamed_on_spotify
  FROM spotify 
  GROUP BY track
) AS t1

  AND streamed_on_youtube <> 0;
```
# Get top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist
```
WITH ranking_artist AS (

  FROM spotify 
  GROUP BY artist, track
)
SELECT *

WHERE rank <= 3;
```
# List tracks where liveness is above the average
```
SELECT track, artist, liveness 
FROM spotify 
WHERE liveness > (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);
```
# Show difference between max and min energy for each album
```
WITH q13 AS (
  SELECT album, 
         MAX(energy) AS highest_energy, 
         MIN(energy) AS lowest_energy

       highest_energy - lowest_energy AS energy_difference

# Outcome & Findings
The project helped identify key patterns such as the most streamed tracks, top-viewed artists, genre-based performance, and trends in engagement metrics. Complex queries involving ranking, aggregation, and condition-based filtering revealed deeper insights into listening behaviors across platforms like YouTube and Spotify.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured SQL logic can turn raw music data into valuable insights. It also reflects strong command over joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions while reinforcing real-world data handling skills.
